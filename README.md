Terraform module for bringing an AWS Control Tower workload/application account into governance.

---






It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [GNU General Public License](LICENSE).









## Introduction


This module should be used on your standard workload and application accounts.

The terraform-aws-account-baseline module enforces security and management best practices across AWS accounts. It provides standardized configurations for:

    * Account security baselines
    * Account management settings
    * Compliance requirements

This module helps maintain consistent security controls and configurations when managing multiple AWS accounts through Terraform.

### Features

#### Submodule: Account

**Usage**: Apply once to an account.

  * AWS IAM Account Alias: Creates a custom account alias for simplified AWS account identification
  * AWS IAM Account Password Policy: Sets strong password requirements for IAM users
  * AWS S3 Account Public Access Block: Prevents public access to S3 buckets at the account level
  * AWS IAM OpenID Connect Provider: Enables identity federation through OpenID Connect
      * GitHub
      * GitLab
      * Keycloak


#### Submodule: Regional

**Usage**: Apply to each region in an account.

* EBS Encryption by Default: Ensures all new EBS volumes are automatically encrypted
* Block public EBS snapshot sharing: Prevents EBS snapshots from being shared publicly
* Terraform State Resources:
    * Terraform State Bucket: Stores Terraform state files securely
    * Terraform DynamoDB State Lock Table: Prevents concurrent state modifications



## Usage




```terraform
module "account" {
  source = "git::https://gitlab.com/guardianproject-ops/terraform-aws-account-baseline//modules/account?ref=main"
}

module "region_main" {
  source = "git::https://gitlab.com/guardianproject-ops/terraform-aws-account-baseline//modules/region?ref=main"
  providers = {
